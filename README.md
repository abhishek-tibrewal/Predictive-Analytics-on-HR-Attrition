# Predictive-Analytics-on-HR-Attrition
We tried to find out the employees who can potentially leave the company in near future based on several factors. In this case, we had attributes like: overtime, number of years worked, satisfaction level, stock option level, distance traveled by employees to office, project with current manager, hourly rate and many more. From all these attributes, we found out that overtime and monthly income are the most important factors on which employees can leave. 

For this model, we used SPSS Modeler to create our model from the training data set (used CART, C 4.5, C 5.1, Random Forest and ANN). We used IBM Watson Analytics to predict the name of the employees who can leave based on our model. 

This model can be very useful for HR department of any company. They can improve their retention strategies based on these results and benefit their company by not only saving top talents but also $25000 approx. (for each employee they save from leaving in a year).
